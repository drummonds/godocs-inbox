# Roadmap

## Planned

## Feature set manage the whole queue

- Be able to go forwards and backwards in the inbox queue eg working on 3 of 148  (this allows you to skip items)

## Add background tasks

- I want the LLM date classifier to run in the background on the whole queue
- you may want to prevent updating until the date has been classified
- Extend the classifier to work on rotation 
    >> godocs is going to need a orientation feature
